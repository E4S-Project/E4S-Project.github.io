<p>E4S (Ecosystem for Science) is a community-driven, open-source software ecosystem that provides a curated collection of interoperable scientific libraries, tools, and frameworks. Contributing your software to E4S connects your project to a broad network of HPC and AI software stakeholders, improves discoverability and interoperability, and supports long-term sustainability.</p>

<p>This guide helps prospective contributors understand why and how to join E4S, what prerequisites exist, and what ongoing responsibilities are expected once accepted.</p>

    <tr>
      <td>5. Validate using E4S CI</td>
      <td>Work with the E4S CI team to test your package within the E4S build pipeline and verify that it can be included in E4S releases.</td>

      <th>Concern</th>
      <th>E4S Perspective</th>
    </tr>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>“Joining E4S reduces our project’s independence.”</td>
      <td>E4S emphasizes project autonomy. Each product retains its own governance, repositories, and branding; E4S simply provides shared infrastructure and visibility.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>“We can reach users ourselves without E4S.”</td>
      <td>While independent outreach is valuable, E4S enhances discoverability within a trusted ecosystem used by major HPC facilities and research teams worldwide.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>“Integration might be too much work.”</td>
      <td>Most projects that already build with Spack require minimal extra effort. E4S CI and support teams assist with integration and testing.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>“Our project isn’t ready yet.”</td>
      <td>That’s fine—E4S welcomes projects when they’re ready. Early coordination, however, helps identify gaps in packaging, testing, and documentation.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>“What if E4S changes direction?”</td>
      <td>E4S operates as an open, community-driven effort with transparent processes, public discussions, and broad stakeholder representation across labs, universities, and vendors.</td>
