<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>The E4S development process ensures that scientific software products are integrated, tested, and maintained in a consistent, portable, and reproducible manner across diverse high-performance computing environments. E4S releases are built around community collaboration, rigorous testing, and continuous improvement of the curated software ecosystem.</p>

<p>E4S provides two major releases each year, labeled as <strong>E4S XX.YY</strong>, where <strong>XX</strong> is the two-digit year and <strong>YY</strong> is the two-digit month. These releases are aligned with the U.S. Supercomputing Conference (SC) and the International Supercomputing Conference (ISC), ensuring that the E4S stack is synchronized with leading HPC and AI research events. Between these major releases, E4S continues to integrate and validate new packages, maintaining an active and evolving ecosystem.</p>
