<p>The <strong>E4S (Ecosystem for Scientific Software)</strong> distribution integrates a growing set of AI and machine learning (AI/ML) libraries and tools that complement traditional scientific computing workflows. These capabilities help users harness the power of machine learning for data analysis, surrogate modeling, uncertainty quantification, and hybrid AI–HPC workflows that accelerate discovery.</p>

<p>AI/ML tools in E4S are designed to interoperate with established programming models (such as MPI, Kokkos, and OpenMP) and numerical libraries (such as PETSc and Trilinos), enabling scientific applications to adopt AI methods without compromising portability, performance, or maintainability across diverse architectures.</p>

<h2 id="the-value-of-using-aiml-libraries-and-tools">The Value of Using AI/ML Libraries and Tools</h2>

<p>AI/ML libraries and tools provide new ways to accelerate scientific computing and data-driven discovery. They help researchers create predictive models that learn from data, automate analysis of large-scale simulations, and bridge the gap between traditional numerical modeling and emerging data-centric approaches.</p>

<p>By leveraging AI/ML libraries that are part of E4S, users benefit from:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Portability and performance:</strong> E4S ensures compatibility with DOE leadership-class systems and major hardware platforms (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, ARM).</li>
  <li><strong>Interoperability:</strong> AI/ML frameworks integrate with high-performance data and math libraries, facilitating hybrid workflows that combine simulation and learning.</li>
  <li><strong>Reproducibility:</strong> E4S provides well-tested, versioned, and build-cached environments, simplifying deployment across HPC facilities.</li>
  <li><strong>Extensibility:</strong> The ecosystem supports emerging AI models, scientific surrogates, and domain-aware learning frameworks built by national labs and research partners.</li>
</ul>

<p>E4S thus bridges the growing intersection between traditional simulation-based computing and modern AI-driven workflows.</p>
