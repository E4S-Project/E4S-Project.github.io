<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>The new <strong>E4S Project website</strong> represents a major evolution from the original site.<br />
It builds on years of experience curating, integrating, and deploying scientific software for extreme-scale computing while introducing a modern, user-focused design that helps <strong>researchers, developers, and educators</strong> find and use E4S software more effectively.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="1-expanded-focus-reaching-new-users">1. Expanded Focus: Reaching New Users</h2>

<p>The new site emphasizes <strong>accessibility and discovery</strong> for new users of scientific libraries and tools.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The content structure, layout, and language have been redesigned to make it easier for users who are new to HPC and E4S to explore available software options.</li>
  <li>Key entry points such as the <strong>E4S Product Guides</strong>, <strong>Feature Grids</strong>, and <strong>Interactive Buttons</strong> lead users toward curated information for their domain—whether they are working in AI/ML, math libraries, data tools, or performance analysis.</li>
  <li>Each guide provides a set of <strong>attributes</strong> to help users describe their problem and environment, allowing E4S resources and bots to recommend the most relevant tools.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="2-e4s-guide-bot-and-custom-chatbots">2. E4S Guide Bot and Custom Chatbots</h2>

<p>A major new capability is the <strong>E4S Guide Bot</strong>, an AI-powered assistant designed to help users navigate the E4S ecosystem.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Guide Bot integrates with a <strong>curated collection of project documents</strong>, including user guides, release notes, and descriptions of E4S member products.</li>
  <li>Customizable versions of the bot can be embedded or extended for <strong>specific SDKs, product families, or institutional deployments</strong>, enabling domain-specific assistance.</li>
  <li>Users can engage with the bot through natural language queries to learn about installation procedures, compatibility, and ecosystem relationships—reducing the learning curve for new users.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="3-product-family-emphasis">3. Product Family Emphasis</h2>

<p>The new site highlights the <strong>role of product families</strong> within the E4S ecosystem.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Each family (e.g., Math Libraries, Data &amp; Visualization Tools, AI/ML Frameworks, Performance Tools, Build Tools) is treated as a first-class component of the ecosystem.</li>
  <li>Families provide a <strong>structured view</strong> of the E4S portfolio, showing how related products interoperate and complement one another.</li>
  <li>Within each family page, users can explore <strong>member products</strong>, see <strong>feature comparisons</strong>, and access relevant <strong>Spack package details</strong> and <strong>container availability</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="4-attribute-based-product-selection">4. Attribute-Based Product Selection</h2>

<p>For each product family, the new site introduces <strong>attribute tables</strong> that describe the key considerations for selecting an appropriate library or tool.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Users can define these attributes for their own problem or environment—such as programming model, target hardware, data precision, or interoperability requirements.</li>
  <li>Once defined, these attributes can be used in prompts to the <strong>E4S Guide Bot</strong>, enabling AI-assisted tool selection.</li>
  <li>This approach encourages consistent, transparent reasoning across the entire ecosystem and provides a foundation for future <strong>automated recommendation systems</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="5-modernized-presentation-and-infrastructure">5. Modernized Presentation and Infrastructure</h2>

<p>Beyond its expanded content, the new E4S site incorporates significant enhancements in design and maintainability:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Built on a <strong>customized Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme</strong>, providing a responsive layout and support for modern CSS/HTML features.</li>
  <li><strong>Feature grids, oval buttons, and integrated navigation menus</strong> simplify movement between product areas and documentation portals.</li>
  <li>A consistent footer, navigation structure, and metadata framework support improved long-term curation and automated documentation generation.</li>
  <li>Enhanced <strong>integration with E4S GitHub repositories</strong> allows synchronized updates with each E4S release (e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">E4S 25.06</code> and later).</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="6-enhanced-user-engagement">6. Enhanced User Engagement</h2>

<p>The new site makes it easier to connect with the E4S community:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Direct links to <strong>Slack</strong>, <strong>GitHub Discussions</strong>, and <strong>Issue trackers</strong> for each project.</li>
  <li>Contextual help and “Contact the Team” links integrated into relevant pages.</li>
  <li>More prominent visibility for DOE sponsorship and the <strong>Linux Foundation Projects</strong> affiliation.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="looking-ahead">Looking Ahead</h2>

<p>The redesigned E4S site establishes a foundation for <strong>continuous ecosystem evolution</strong>—where documentation, guidance, and community engagement evolve alongside the software.<br />
Future plans include tighter integration between the Guide Bot and the E4S documentation repositories, interactive attribute-driven product filtering, and expanded support for AI-enabled scientific workflows.</p>
