      <td>Pre-requisite</td>
      <td>Justification for being included. The product must have some value or strong potential value to the HPC-AI community with functionality to address scientific problems. In other words, it must make sense for the product to belong to E4S.</td>

    <tr>
      <td>Level 0</td>
      <td>Be listed in the E4S Spack installation script and be buildable in all E4S target environments. The list of Spack recipes for E4S is <a href="https://github.com/E4S-Project/e4s/tree/master/environments">here</a>.</td>

    <tr>
      <td>Level 1</td>
      <td>Be present in the <a href="/product-catalog/">E4S Product Catalog</a>. To achieve this, we need a URL to your main repo to add to <a href="https://github.com/E4S-Project/E4S-Documenter/blob/master/data/e4s_products.yaml">this list</a>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Level 2</td>
      <td>Satisfy all <a href="/policies/">E4S community policies</a>. Full satisfaction is not required at this time. We are still establishing a process. Note that derived requirements from E4S member packages are not required to satisfy community policies as long as they do not destabilize E4S builds or portability.</td>
