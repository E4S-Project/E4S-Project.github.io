    <tr>
      <td>From-Source Builds</td>
      <td>E4S utilizes <a href="https://spack.io">Spack</a>, a flexible package manager, to facilitate building software directly from source. This allows users to customize builds for their specific systems. Instructions: <a href="/spack-installation/">General Spack usage instructions</a> for installing individual products. <a href="/spack-e4s-installation/">E4S-specific Installation Guide</a> for working with Spack and E4S.</td>

    <tr>
      <td>Spack Build Cache</td>
      <td>Pre-built binaries provided via Spack build caches enable faster installations without local compilation. More information available on the <a href="/e4s-buildcache/">E4S Buildcache Page</a>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Containers</td>
      <td>E4S offers containerized versions of its software stack, compatible with Docker, Singularity, Shifter, and CharlieCloud. See the <a href="/container-download/">Container Download Page</a> for available containers. See side menu for additional container information.</td>

    <tr>
      <td>Commercial Cloud Options</td>
      <td>E4S containers are  available via <a href="https://paratoolspro.com">ParaTools Pro for E4S™</a>, including <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-ozpychswxmldi">AWS Marketplace</a>. E4S can be deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS) for scalable cloud-based HPC/AI workloads and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) with access to high-performance VMs and storage.</td>

    <tr>
      <td>Test using E4S</td>
      <td>E4S can be used for upstream or downstream testing of your own software products. For example, if you produce compilers or tools for HPC-AI users, E4S can be a reasonable proxy for the HPC-AI user community.  See <a href="/test-with-e4s/">Test with E4S</a> for more details.</td>
