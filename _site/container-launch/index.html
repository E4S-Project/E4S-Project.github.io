<p>E4S Container Launch is an effort to facilitate the use of MPI applications developed using E4S containers on supercomputers without having to compile a new binary on the host.</p>

<p>Given a combination of an MPI library, a container and a MPI binary, E4S Container Launch will run the MPI binary in the target container using the MPI library. This is useful when the binary has been compiled using a different library than the one passed as an argument: as long as the two libraries are <a href="https://www.mpich.org/abi/">ABI compatible</a>, the binary will run under the new environment.</p>

<p>E4S Container Launch includes tools to automatically detect the MPI binary's necessary files, making it seamless to set up and use.</p>

<p>The source code is available at the <a href="https://github.com/E4S-Project/e4s-cl">E4S-CL GitHub repository</a>. The documentation is also available <a href="https://e4s-cl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">here</a>.</p>
