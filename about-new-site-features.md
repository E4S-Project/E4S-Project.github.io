## Overview

The new **E4S Project website** represents a major evolution from the original site.  
It builds on years of experience curating, integrating, and deploying scientific software for extreme-scale computing while introducing a modern, user-focused design that helps **researchers, developers, and educators** find and use E4S software more effectively.

---

## 1. Expanded Focus: Reaching New Users

The new site emphasizes **accessibility and discovery** for new users of scientific libraries and tools.

- The content structure, layout, and language have been redesigned to make it easier for users who are new to HPC and E4S to explore available software options.  
- Key entry points such as the **E4S Product Guides**, **Feature Grids**, and **Interactive Buttons** lead users toward curated information for their domain—whether they are working in AI/ML, math libraries, data tools, or performance analysis.
- Each guide provides a set of **attributes** to help users describe their problem and environment, allowing E4S resources and bots to recommend the most relevant tools.

---

## 2. E4S Guide Bot and Custom Chatbots

A major new capability is the **E4S Guide Bot**, an AI-powered assistant designed to help users navigate the E4S ecosystem.

- The Guide Bot integrates with a **curated collection of project documents**, including user guides, release notes, and descriptions of E4S member products.  
- Customizable versions of the bot can be embedded or extended for **specific SDKs, product families, or institutional deployments**, enabling domain-specific assistance.
- Users can engage with the bot through natural language queries to learn about installation procedures, compatibility, and ecosystem relationships—reducing the learning curve for new users.

---

## 3. Product Family Emphasis

The new site highlights the **role of product families** within the E4S ecosystem.

- Each family (e.g., Math Libraries, Data & Visualization Tools, AI/ML Frameworks, Performance Tools, Build Tools) is treated as a first-class component of the ecosystem.  
- Families provide a **structured view** of the E4S portfolio, showing how related products interoperate and complement one another.  
- Within each family page, users can explore **member products**, see **feature comparisons**, and access relevant **Spack package details** and **container availability**.

---

## 4. Attribute-Based Product Selection

For each product family, the new site introduces **attribute tables** that describe the key considerations for selecting an appropriate library or tool.

- Users can define these attributes for their own problem or environment—such as programming model, target hardware, data precision, or interoperability requirements.  
- Once defined, these attributes can be used in prompts to the **E4S Guide Bot**, enabling AI-assisted tool selection.  
- This approach encourages consistent, transparent reasoning across the entire ecosystem and provides a foundation for future **automated recommendation systems**.

---

## 5. Modernized Presentation and Infrastructure

Beyond its expanded content, the new E4S site incorporates significant enhancements in design and maintainability:

- Built on a **customized Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme**, providing a responsive layout and support for modern CSS/HTML features.  
- **Feature grids, oval buttons, and integrated navigation menus** simplify movement between product areas and documentation portals.  
- A consistent footer, navigation structure, and metadata framework support improved long-term curation and automated documentation generation.  
- Enhanced **integration with E4S GitHub repositories** allows synchronized updates with each E4S release (e.g., `E4S 25.06` and later).

---

## 6. Enhanced User Engagement

The new site makes it easier to connect with the E4S community:

- Direct links to **Slack**, **GitHub Discussions**, and **Issue trackers** for each project.  
- Contextual help and “Contact the Team” links integrated into relevant pages.  
- More prominent visibility for DOE sponsorship and the **Linux Foundation Projects** affiliation.

## Summary of Key Differences from the Original Site

| Area | Previous Site | New Site |
|------|------------------------|-----------|
| Audience | Primarily experienced E4S developers and facility users | Broader inclusion of new and prospective users |
| Navigation | Flat menus and static product lists | Hierarchical guides by product family and attributes |
| Support | Static links to documentation | Interactive E4S Guide Bot with access to curated content |
| Product Organization | Alphabetical product catalog | Product families with relationships and attribute tables |
| Visual Design | Basic static pages | Modern responsive layout with feature grids and custom buttons |
| Interactivity | Limited search | Integrated chat, guided exploration, and filtered tables |
| Ecosystem Context | Implicit relationships | Explicit emphasis on SDK-level and family-level structures |

---

## Looking Ahead

The redesigned E4S site establishes a foundation for **continuous ecosystem evolution**—where documentation, guidance, and community engagement evolve alongside the software.  
Future plans include tighter integration between the Guide Bot and the E4S documentation repositories, interactive attribute-driven product filtering, and expanded support for AI-enabled scientific workflows.
