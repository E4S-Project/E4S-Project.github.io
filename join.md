E4S represents a growing community of HPC software products. Please [contact us](/contact/) if you would like your product to be a part of E4S.

## E4S Levels and Requirements

| Level          | Requirements |
|----------------|--------------|
| Pre-requisite  | Justification for being included. The product must have some value or strong potential value to the HPC-AI community with functionality to address scientific problems. In other words, it must make sense for the product to belong to E4S. |
| Level 0        | Be listed in the E4S Spack installation script and be buildable in all E4S target environments. The list of Spack recipes for E4S is [here](https://github.com/E4S-Project/e4s/tree/master/environments). |
| Level 1        | Be present in the [E4S Product Catalog](/product-catalog/). To achieve this, we need a URL to your main repo to add to [this list](https://github.com/E4S-Project/E4S-Documenter/blob/master/data/e4s_products.yaml). |
| Level 2        | Satisfy all [E4S community policies](/policies/). Full satisfaction is not required at this time. We are still establishing a process. Note that derived requirements from E4S member packages are not required to satisfy community policies as long as they do not destabilize E4S builds or portability. |
