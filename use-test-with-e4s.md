## E4S as a Proxy for HPC-AI User codes
If you produce compilers, libraries, and tools for HPC-AI software development teams, E4S can be a good proxy for a broad set of users.  E4S contains a variety of libraries, tools, and test executables that are:
- Relatively easy to build using Spack
- Representative of many HPC-AI user codes
- Usable for pre-merge or post-merge regression testing of changes you make to your code
- Useable for release-candidate testing prior to release to the general user community.

Using E4S this way can help impression users first impressions of your software.

## E4S Testing Resources

E4S provides modest but diverse testing resources that are available to E4S product teams.  Access to these resources are presently managed via the PESO Project, which has the primary stewardship role for E4S.
