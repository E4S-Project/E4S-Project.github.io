Provide a newcomer an introduction to linear equation solvers as provided by libraries supported by e4s, found at https:/e4s.io

In addition to basic concepts, provide paragraphs on the following:
1. The value of using optimized libraries for dense linear algebra for performance
2. Basic concepts in sparse linear algebra.
3. The difference between direct and iterative solution methods.
4. A table that briefly shows what each E4S library provides for dense vs sparse and direct vs iterative capabilities
