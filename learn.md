## Purpose

E4S Learning provides a curated entry point into the Ecosystem for Scientific Software.  
Its goal is to help users understand, adopt, and effectively use E4S software across
high-performance computing and AI-enabled scientific workflows.

This collection emphasizes **practical capability**, **conceptual clarity**, and
**ecosystem coherence**, rather than exhaustive reference documentation.

---

## Who This Is For

E4S Learning is organized for multiple audiences, each with distinct needs and entry points.

### Newcomers and Explorers
Graduate students, postdocs, and new staff seeking an overview of E4S and how its components
fit together.

**You will gain:** orientation, vocabulary, and a clear path to first success.

### Application Developers
Domain scientists and research programmers building or modernizing applications.

**You will gain:** guidance on performance portability, correctness, and sustainable development.

### Software and Infrastructure Engineers
Those responsible for build systems, packaging, CI/CD, containers, and deployment.

**You will gain:** reproducible workflows and ecosystem-level integration strategies.

### Facility, Program, and Project Stakeholders
Center leadership, program managers, and vendors.

**You will gain:** insight into ecosystem structure, adoption signals, and long-term sustainability.

## How Learning Is Organized

E4S Learning is structured to support progressive engagement rather than linear reading.

### Learning Tiers

- **Orientation**  
  What E4S is, why it exists, and how the ecosystem fits together.

- **Quick Starts**  
  First hands-on experiences using real tools and environments.

- **Core Competencies**  
  Skills needed to work effectively with E4S software in practice.

- **Advanced and Integrative Topics**  
  Scaling, AI integration, mixed precision, and emerging practices.

Users are encouraged to follow **learning paths** aligned with their roles, rather than
consuming content exhaustively.

---

## Current Status

E4S Learning is under active development.

Initial materials focus on:
- Ecosystem orientation
- Foundational workflows
- Early onboarding experiences

Content will expand iteratively and align with future E4S releases.

---

## What You Can Do Now

While the collection grows, you can:

- Explore introductory material on the E4S ecosystem  
- Follow an initial Quick Start when available  
- Review learning topics as they are published  

Links will appear here as content is added.

---

## Relationship to the E4S Ecosystem

Learning resources are tightly coupled to the E4S ecosystem itself.

They reference and reinforce:
- E4S product families
- Supported build and packaging workflows
- Containers and continuous integration artifacts
- Release processes and facility deployments

Learning materials are designed to point **into** E4S assets, not replace them.

---

## Community and Contributions

E4S Learning is a community-curated effort.

Contributions are welcome from:
- Application teams
- Software developers
- Facilities and vendors
- Educators and trainers

Clear contribution guidelines will be provided as the collection matures.

---

## Looking Ahead

Planned additions include:
- Role-specific learning paths
- Hands-on tutorials validated by CI
- Deeper integration with E4S releases
- Case studies drawn from real applications

E4S Learning is intended to evolve as durable ecosystem infrastructure.
